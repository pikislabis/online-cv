    summary: |
      I am a Full Stack developer with 10 years of experience in the development
      of advanced web applications, mainly focused on the visualization of data
      from analytical platforms.

      I have experience in the design and development of applications based on
      responsive dashboards, making use of libraries such as React.js and

      data in multitenancy environments. All these services have been

      During my work experience I have used agile development methodologies,
      such as SCRUM, helping in the management of the Product Backlog.
